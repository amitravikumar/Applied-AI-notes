# Applied-AI-notes
This repository will contain notes and all the learning and daily updates for the progress of Applied Machine Learning course.

You may also fork this repository and use the resources in the repository for the learning process only. 

Stay tuned and check daily for the notes and updates topic wise.

# NOTE: tensorflowdoesnâ€™t work with python 3.7, please install python version 3.6 only.

The current anaconda installs with python 3.7 use this link if you have not already installed. The versions might differ but the product will be the same with some advanced features added to the repo. I suggest forking it as I will be updating and you'll also be constantly updated.
